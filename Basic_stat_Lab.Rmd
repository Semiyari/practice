1. In Hong Kong, human male height is approximately normally distributed with mean 171.5 cm and standard deviation 5.5 cm. (Use and show R code to produce answers for a â€“ e) You can use any method for part f.
  a. What proportion fo the Hong Kong population is between 170cm and 180cm ? 
```{r}
prob_a <- pnorm(mean = 171.5, sd = 5.5, q = 170)
prob_a
prob_b <- pnorm(mean = 171.5, sd = 5.5, q = 180)
prob_b
# proportion between 170 and 180
prob_b - prob_a
```


```{r}
l <- 171.5 - 5*5.5
u <- 171.5 + 5*5.5
x<- seq(l, u, length = 100)
y<- dnorm(x=x , mean = 171.5, sd = 5.5)
df_1 <- data.frame(x = c(170, x [170<x & x<180], 180), 
                   y = c(0, y[170<x & x<180], 0))

           label = round(1-pt(0.355,2),4),color = "red")

# the value immediately above the proportion 0.355 is 0.3783
```


9. An educator believes that new directed reading activities in the classroom will help elementary school pupils improve some aspects of their ability. She arranges for a third -grade class of 23 students to take part in these activities for an eight-week period. A control classroom of 23 third graders follows the same curriculum without the activities. At the end of the eight weeks, all students are given a Degree of Reading Power (DRP) test, which measures the aspects of reading ability that the treatment is designed to improve. The sample data performance results are provided below: 

    - Treatment Group: 24,61,59,46,43,44,52,43,58,67,62,57,71,49,54,43,53,57,49,56,33,74,70
    - Control Group: 42,33,46,37,43,41,10,42,55,19,17,55,26,54,60,28,62,20,53,48,37,85,42
    - Design and execute a two sample t test.
        a. State the appropriate null and alt hypotheses

H0: there is no significant difference between the mean scores of the treatment and control groups of the DRP test.
Ha: There is a significant difference between the mean scores of the treatment and control groups on the DRP test. 
        
        b. Use and show R code to produce the p value and the confidence interval
```{r}
c(24,61,59,46,43,44,52,43,58,67,62,57,71,49,54,43,53,57,49,56,33,74,70) ->
  tg
c(42,33,46,37,43,41,10,42,55,19,17,55,26,54,60,28,62,20,53,48,37,85,42) ->
  cg
```
  
```{r}
t.test(tg, cg, mu = 0, var.equal = FALSE)
```

p-value, 0.01, is less than a=0.05, and the 95% CI is [2.9,20.58] as shown through the t.test() output.

        c. Determine if you should reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis using the p value and the confidence interval.

Based on the p-value and Confidence interval, we can reject the null hypothesis and say that there is evidence that **there is a significant** difference between the mean scores of the treatment and control groups on the DRP test.
