    {r}

    ```{r}
    # a calculate Zs
    mean <- 171.5
    lower <- 170
    upper <- 180
    sd <- 5.5
    z1 <- (lower - mean)/ sd
    z2 <- (upper - mean)/ sd
    # Area under 
    curveprop <- pnorm(z2) - pnorm(z1)prop

    #b 
    mean_height <- 171.5
    sd_height <- 5.5
    height_165 <- 165

    prop_less_than_165 <- pnorm(height_165, mean = mean_height, sd = sd_height)
    prop_less_than_165
    #c
    mean_height <- 171.5
    sd_height <- 5.5
    height_175 <- 175

    prop_greater_than_175 <- pnorm(height_175, mean = mean_height, sd = sd_height, lower.tail = FALSE)
    prop_greater_than_175
    #d
    mean_height <- 171.5
    sd_height <- 5.5
    prop_below_height <- 0.25

    height_value <- qnorm(prop_below_height, mean = mean_height, sd = sd_height)
    height_value
    #e
    mean_height <- 171.5
    sd_height <- 5.5
    prop_below_height <- 0.85

    height_value <- qnorm(prop_below_height, mean = mean_height, sd = sd_height)
    height_value
    #f
    mean_height <- 171.5
    sd_height <- 5.5
    prop_below_upper_height <- 0.84 # 0.68 / 2 + 0.16
    prop_below_lower_height <- 0.16 # 0.68 / 2

    upper_height_value <- qnorm(prop_below_upper_height, mean = mean_height, sd = sd_height)
    lower_height_value <- qnorm(prop_below_lower_height, mean = mean_height, sd = sd_height)
    c(lower_height_value, upper_height_value)






    ```

2)  Use and show R code to determine the height of the standard normal curve at a Z value of 2.5.

    ```{r}
    z_value <- 2.5

    height <- dnorm(z_value)
    height

    ```

3)  Use and show R code to determine the height of the standard normal curve at a Z value of .4.

    ```{r}
    z_value <- 0.4

    height <- dnorm(z_value)
    height


    ```

    \
    \

4)  Use and show R code to determine the height of a t distribution curve for a t value of 1.5 with 3 degrees of freedom.

    ```{r}

    ```

5)  Use and show R code to determine the height of a t distribution curve for a t value of -2 with 2 degrees of freedom.

    ```{r}
    t_value <- 1.5
    df <- 3

    height <- dt(t_value, df)
    height

    ```

    \
    \

6)  For a t distribution with 3 degrees of freedom, use and show R code that will find the proportion less than 2.5.

    ```{r}
    t_value <- 2.5
    df <- 3

    prop_less_than_2.5 <- pt(t_value, df, lower.tail = TRUE)
    prop_less_than_2.5


    ```

    \

7)  For a t distribution with 1 degree of freedom, use and show R code that will find the proportion that is greater than 1.75.

    ```{r}
    t_value <- 1.75
    df <- 1

    prop_greater_than_1.75 <- pt(t_value, df, lower.tail = FALSE)
    prop_greater_than_1.75


    ```

8)  For a t distribution with 2 degrees of freedom, use and show R code that will find the value immediately above a proportion of .355.

    ```{r}
    prop <- 0.355
    df <- 2

    t_value_above_prop <- ceiling(qt(1 - prop, df))
    t_value_above_prop

    ```

9)  An educator believes that new directed reading activities in the classroom will help elementary school pupils improve some aspects of their ability. She arranges for a third -grade class of 23 students to take part in these activities for an eight-week period. A control classroom of 23 third graders follows the same curriculum without the activities. At the end of the eight weeks, all students are given a Degree of Reading Power (DRP) test, which measures the aspects of reading ability that the treatment is designed to improve. The sample data performance results are provided below;

-   Treatment Group: 24,61,59,46,43,44,52,43,58,67,62,57,71,49,54,43,53,57,49,56,33,74,70

-   Control Group: 42,33,46,37,43,41,10,42,55,19,17,55,26,54,60,28,62,20,53,48,37,85,42

-   Design and execute a two sample t test.\
    a) State the appropriate null and alternative hypotheses.

    b)  Use and show R code to produce the p value and the confidence interval c) Determine if you should reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis using the p value and the confidence interval.

        a)

        Null hypothesis: The mean DRP test scores for the treatment group and control group are equal.
        Alternative hypothesis: The mean DRP test scores for the treatment group and control group are not equal.

        In mathematical notation:

        H0: μt = μc
        Ha: μt ≠ μc

        where μt is the population mean DRP test score for the treatment group, and μc is the population mean DRP test score for the control group.

        To conduct the two-sample t-test, we can use the **`t.test`** function in R. We will pass the two samples and specify that it is a two-sample t-test with unequal variances. Here's the R code to perform the two-sample t-test:

```{r}
treatment <- c(24,61,59,46,43,44,52,43,58,67,62,57,71,49,54,43,53,57,49,56,33,74,70)
control <- c(42,33,46,37,43,41,10,42,55,19,17,55,26,54,60,28,62,20,53,48,37,85,42)

t_test <- t.test(treatment, control, var.equal = FALSE)
t_test

```

The p-value is 0.0001322114, which is less than the usual significance level of 0.05, indicating strong evidence against the null hypothesis. The confidence interval is (-33.23257, -9.38061), which does not include 0, providing further evidence in support of the alternative hypothesis.
